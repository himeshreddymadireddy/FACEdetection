## Face Recognition Attendance System

This project is a Face Recognition Attendance System that automates attendance marking in a classroom using facial recognition. The system captures and detects faces from an input image, matches them with stored student images, and generates an attendance report in Excel format.

## Features


Face Detection: Utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces in a classroom image.
Face Recognition: Compares detected faces with pre-stored student images using the Face Recognition library.
Attendance Marking: Automatically marks students as present if their face is recognized in the image.
Export to Excel: Attendance data (both present and absent students) is exported to an Excel file for easy record-keeping.üßê
